# Leaving Procedure

## Our Leaving Process

We don't have team members leave often. It's sad when they do but we also want to make sure there is a clear process to follow so we all can focus on spending time together and saying proper goodbyes rather than worrying about some of these details. 

## Thinking of leaving?

We always hope you'll talk with us if you're unhappy - we never, ever want anyone to leave if we can avoid it. So when in doubt, talk with Nathan or Eric. 

If, however, you do decide it's time to move on to pastures new, you'll need to let Nathan and Eric know, and make it official over email. We'll then calculate your last day, and moneys owed. 

In your resignation email, please ensure the following:

* The date of resignation
* Your requested final day (this may not be your actual final day, dependant on your contractual notice period, holidays accrued, etc)
* Optionally, your reason for leaving

## What to do in your last month(s)

Nathan and Eric will share the news with the team. We value doing it this way because it helps ensure we have a plan in place to help alleviate any anxiety that a leaving team member can cause for others. So please hold onto the news until the team is told. We'll communicate about this to be transparent about the process. 

Once it's known across the team, we'd ask you to go about your job as if it were any other day. The only change might be ensuring you're on top of communication and documentation more than you would have been before. That's because you'll need to eventually hand over your work and we want that to be as easy as possible on you and others on the team.

## What to do in your last week or so

Towards the end, you'll want to start to set up chats with others who you'll be handing work over to. Some things to keep in mind for each role:

### Project Managers

- By this point, you'll be in communication with Eric about who will manage your projects. It's therefore super important your project trackers are up to date. 
- You'll also want to ensure your successor has been introduced to your clients. Make sure you talk with Eric about the timing of this so it's all well planned and instills confidence in the client that we have processes to help the transition go smoothly. 
- Make sure all of your notes are in Google Drive. 
- Teamwork: look over each of your projects and ensure it's clean, tidy and that someone else could easily read through it.
- Billing: have you submitted all requests for billing across your projects?
-

### Designers
- Hopefully you'll be at a point where you're nearly finished up any project. In the case where you need to hand over a project at a mid-way point, then ensure Sketch has a clear style library setup and have a few chats with the designer who will take over to make sure they understand previous client conversations and where the site is going. Where possible, do collaborative design so your successor maybe designs a page and then you give feedback so you're both moving forward on the project together. 
- Make sure your Sketch files are all in Sketch Cloud and organised into project folders. 
- If you've used any other programme like Illustrator, XD, Figma, etc that you have created a folder per project and that the folder of all of these projects is handed over to Eric. 

### Developers
- Hopefully you'll be leaving at a point where the big project you were on is finished up. If it's not, then arrange a handover to the developer who will be taking over the work. Give context about the project so the developer understands the brand and try to talk through the site in how it was built so far, going page by page and using designs as a reference as you talk through. Discuss next steps you would have taken should you finished the site to help the new developer understand how they may approach what's next. 
- Make sure all work has been pushed up to Git so there isn't any stray work that only lives locally. 
- Make sure any Sketch file you had been working from is in Sketch Cloud (that's mostly important if you're working with an external design agency but you should probably already have it in Sketch as that's usually a first step of any project). 


## What to do on your last day

It's a sad day and we'll miss you! There are a few more of the formal bits on the last day:

- Make sure you bring in all company property to the office including computer, power cable, dongle, monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. Everything must be received before your final paycheck can be released
- Change the password on your computer and attach it as a sticky note on the machine. Eric will test it first to make sure we can login just in case any files might be needed
- Clean your desk
- Check the kitchen to make sure you're not leaving anything behind
- Enjoy a drink with the team!
- Pass your key to Nathan or Eric

## After depature

You'll receive your final pay during the normal end of monthy pay period. This will be adjusted to include any unused holiday, too. 

You'll have access to FreeAgent for payroll where you can get any payslips or a P45 so make sure you remember the login you setup when you first created the account.  Access will remain for at least 3 months after you leave, so may sure you take copies of anything you need.  If you need something in the future and no longer have access, please email Nathan.
