# Where We Work

## From Our Office

We're based out of West London in Westbourne Grove. We've got a lovely space and workstations for everyone on the team alongside some nice little amenities like a fridge stocked with beverages, all you can eat Allplants (insider joke you'll soon learn about), an espresso machine and some of the standards you'd expect in any English kitchen. During the pandemic, we closed down our office but from summer 2021 are slowly returning. We'll eventually work three days a week from this space with the other days at a place of your choosing (exceptions apply, see working from home below). There are the occassional times when you may need to come in more often and, of course, you can always voluntarily work out of the office more if that's where you work better. 

When you're in the office, please keep the following in mind:

- Dress sensibly: We have clients in the office and it's nice to look nice. For most of us, it's a smart casual affair. 
- Bring in some headphones: Others know you're focusing when you have both headphones plugged in. 
- Clean up after yourself: Don't leave it for later. Clean up right away. If you do a really good job, Poppy will bestow upon you an award
- It's a shared space: So keep it nice for everyone else and don't be the person we need to talk with. 

## From Home

We think that some things can be better done at home (and others better in the office) so we give the option for team members to work from home twice a week. We'll get you a nice screen to give you the extra real estate to work, too. 

While, working from home can be great for some people, it can be challenging for others so be aware that work from home is at the discretion of your team lead and company â€“ don't expect it but instead, request it. 

How you're working from home and performance is something we will discuss with each person on the team regularly. 

Any new team members who are within their first six months are expected to come into the office four days a week. We learn best from each other in person and integrating with the team to build relationships is a fundamental aspect of how we work so this extra time will help with both. 

The pandemic has encouraged us and many other companies to reconsider where working can be best done but it's fair to say that quite a bit is an experiment right now and that our working arrangement may change as we evaluate its effectiveness and suitability for our team. 

A little note on call etiquette: 

- Look like you've put some effort in: We are on calls with each other and clients. Look the part - we're not the type of crowed who never puts on video or who looks like they've just rolled out of bed. We're a business and do some seriously good work so even when on video, let's look the part. 
- Don't eat on a call: Get it in before or after.
- Mute yourself if you're typing or around others.
- Pay attention: Nothing worse than someone who is clearly doing other things (unless you're just dragged into a call and really don't need to be there, but then make sure you ask why you're there in the first place as that's a waste of your time).
