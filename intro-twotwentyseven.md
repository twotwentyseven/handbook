# Introduction to twotwentyseven

## twotwentyseven's Story

From a one man show in 2010 to a multi-discpline growing team of a dozen in 2021, twotwentyseven has grown a lot (especially in the past couple of years) but there are a few things which remain constant:

- Relationships still underpin everything we do: Nathan worked in quite a few agencies before starting his own and one early observation was that the agency client relationship was often too transactional. He set out to change that by working with clients we could get on board with and support long-term. This mantra also equally applies internally – we're in this together as a team doing great work.  

- We say yes to solving problems: We got a reputation early on of solving problems other agencies said were unsolvable. From Nathan's work on Psycle that allowed customers to choose their specific bike within a studio (one else was doing that in 2014!) to the flexibility we unlocked by using Shopify when WooCommerce was still cool. So while it's easy to say no (it's also easy to say yes), it's hard to say yes and actually solve a problem elegantly. When in doubt, say yes and then get ready to think hard and work together to get there. 

By focusing on relationships and constantly innovating, we believe we've positioned ourselves well for future growth!

## Our Expertise

We're always trying to add new tools to our arsenal but there are few things we do well:

- Ecommerce on Shopify: We've built hundreds of Shopify stores (most totally bespoke). We understand the platform through and through and are able to do lots of things that clients would otherwise be unable to do unless they moved to the spenny version of Shopify called Plus ($2,000/month... ouch). 

- Laravel and Nova: If Shopify won't do the trick, we then ask whether we can build something custom using Laravel. It's scalable, secure, and flexible allowing us to do things like build out an international multi-lingual site for Fever-Tree and build complex customer journeys like on Natural Fitness Food. 

- CodexFit: Over the years, twotwentyseven has built at least a dozen bespoke booking platforms for gyms. They're a big undertaking, complex and need maintenance - there had to be a better way to get gyms a flexible platform without building every single one custom. We decided in 2019 to build a whitelabled platform that we could license and that's what brought us to CodexFit. We genuinely think it's one of the most flexible platforms out there and we keep onboarding new clients who back up that claim. 

## Our Team

We've ebbed and flow in terms of size and roles on our team over the years.

Since our inception, it's always been a team of developers and designers but in 2018 we added our first full time project manager. We also started to put in place plans to allow us to scale. 

From 2019-2021 we grew from a team of five to a team of a dozen with ambitions to continuing growing.

Our team is organised into frontend development, backend development, design and project management. That being said, every project team generally includes a frontend developer, designer, and project manager. If there is custom work on Laravel or CodexFit, a backender would also get involved. 

We firmly believe in having a t-shaped team meaning each person, while holding a clearly defined role, is allowed and encouraged to contribute beyond their role. In practice, that means a developer might help during strategy or a designer may tackle an animation problem during build. To that end, a project manager isn't just managing the project (that would be great but a bit dull) – our project managers help formulate strategy, solve problems and push the team forward.
