# Who Does What?

We're a small team and that makes it quite easy to figure out who does what. It also means that some people wear quite a few hats. As we grow, we have plans to unpicking some of these roles but for now, this should help serve as a guide for who generally is responsible for what at the leadership level. 

## Nathan, founder and technical director

Hope you know by now but Nathan got the show on the road and founded twotwentyseven round about 2010. He's the one who sets the tone and cool vibe that we've become known for and is the big reason that we're always so passionate about solving problems. 

He's chiefly responsible for:
* Strategic direction of the company
* All legal/HR matters for the organisation
* Pay and pensions
* Setting targets for revenue and growth
* Evaluating performance across the leadership team

As a technical director, he's also looking after:
* Are we building on the right systems?
* Are we using the right tools?
* What's next in tech? What ought we be on the lookout for to stay ahead of trends?

Nathan also serves as the backend team lead and design co team lead with Eric. 

## Eric, operations director

He joined twotwentyseven in 2018 as the first full-time project manager and has transformed processes across the team, introduced transparent pay, setup the appraisal programme and oversees recruitment and expansion. 

He's chiefly responsible for:
* Day to day operations of the company
* Managing team leads and working with them to get the pulse
* Ensuring resource utilisation is optimised
* Improving process
* Recruitment
* Growth/expansion of team and project pipeline
* Meeting revenue and growth targets
* Setting an annual roadmap and following through

Eric also serves as the project management team lead and design co team lead with Nathan. 

## Rich, frontend team lead

Rich has been with twotwentyseven since 2018 and moved into a team lead role in 2020. He's a brilliant self-starter who can pick up something and figure it out just about as quick as Nathan. 

He's chiefly responsible for:
* Anything you see in the [team lead responsibilities](https://github.com/twotwentyseven/handbook/blob/master/team-lead-responsibilities.md).
