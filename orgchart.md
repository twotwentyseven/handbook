# Who Does What?

We're a small team and that makes it quite easy to figure out who does what. It also means that some people wear quite a few hats. As we grow, we have plans to unpick some of these roles but for now, this should help serve as a guide for who generally is responsible for what at the leadership level. 

## Nathan, founder and technical director

Hope you know by now but Nathan got the show on the road and founded twotwentyseven round about 2010. He's the one who sets the tone and cool vibe that we've become known for and is the big reason that we're so passionate about solving problems. 

He's chiefly responsible for:
* Strategic direction of the company
* All legal/HR matters for the company
* Pay and pensions
* Setting targets for revenue and growth
* Evaluating performance across the leadership team

As a technical director, he's also looking after:
* Are we building on the right systems?
* Are we using the right tools?
* What's next in tech? What ought we be on the lookout for to stay ahead of trends?

Nathan also serves as the backend team lead and design co team lead with Poppy. 

## Poppy, head of projects

Poppy joined twotwentyseven in 2019 as a project manager and has since worked her way up to head of projects. 

She's chiefly responsible for:
* Day to day management of the project team
* Managing team leads and working with them and Nathan to keep things running smoothly
* Ensuring resource utilisation is optimised
* Improving process
* Growth/expansion of team and project pipeline
* Meeting revenue and growth targets
* Setting an annual roadmap and following through

Poppy also serves as the unofficial social queen, and organises our summer and winter parties, amongst other social activities.
