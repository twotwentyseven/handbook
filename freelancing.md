# A Note About Freelancing 

We recognise that many of our team members occassionally take on work outside of twotwentyseven. It sometimes helps bring in a little extra moola on the side for those treats or extra savings you're after. We support team members who want to take on some extra work but need to ensure we're clear on what we expect:

- Your twotwentyseven work is what's worked on during twotwentyseven time
- It can't impact your ability to deliver or affect performance
- There shouldn't be a conflict of interest (i.e. you're working for another agency)

Here's a few examples of what's okay vs definitely not okay

## Okay

1. ...

## Not okay

1. ...

## In general

So while we support it, the short story is be sensible. 

* Does it compete with twotwentyseven?
* Does it take up a disproportionate amount of your time?
* Do you need to do it during twotwentyseven time?
* Does it impact your performance?

If the answer is yes to any of it, then please don't do it.
