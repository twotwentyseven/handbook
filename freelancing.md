# A Note About Freelancing 

We recognise that many of our team members occasionally take on work outside of twotwentyseven. It sometimes helps bring in a little extra moola on the side for those treats or extra savings you're after. We support team members who want to take on some extra work but need to ensure we're clear on what we expect:

- Your twotwentyseven work is what's worked on during twotwentyseven time
- It can't impact your ability to deliver or affect performance
- There shouldn't be a conflict of interest (i.e. you're working for another agency)

Here's a few examples of what's okay vs definitely not okay

## Okay

1. Doing some extra work on the weekend for a friend or a small business you're trying to help.
2. Leading an online or in-person workshop to help teach others how to code, design or project manage.
3. Something totally unrelated to your day job... have fun but just make sure you're not tired during twotwentyseven time.
4. Serve as an advisor for another company as long as what they do not compete with what we do.
5. Volunteering... yay! Do it. Paul teaches code as his local school. Help build the future :-)

## Not Okay

1. Taking calls or doing the extra work during twotwentyseven time â€“ this also isn't a good excuse to "flex" time either. 
2. Doing work which competes with what we do. This is somewhat a gray area if you're doing development work but we also understand you may take on slightly different clients than we may so working on smaller gigs that we wouldn't otherwise be able to cater for could be acceptable. 
3. Taking on work that distracts you or consumes you. 

## In General

So while we support it, the short story is be sensible. 

* Does it compete with twotwentyseven?
* Does it take up a disproportionate amount of your time?
* Do you need to do it during twotwentyseven time?
* Does it impact your performance?

If the answer is yes to any of it, then please don't do it. If you're not sure, be open and honest, and speak to your manager or Nathan about it.
