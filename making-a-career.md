# Making a Career

Agencies can sometimes be a bit too transient and we're doing everything we can to change that. There are a few key ideas we pursue in an effort to keep the talented people on our team:

1. Autonomy - we make sure we give people space and time to think and do what they believe is best. We've definitely got some opinions about how we like to do things but we balance this will democratically allowing teams to make decisions, too. 

2. Belonging - This is a familiar one if you've read other parts of this handbook but we want people to feel a part of our team. We have regular socials, recognise good work, and get people together regularly to collaborating brainstorm problems. When you join twotwentyseven, you're joining a team of people who enjoy working together and being a part of the team. 

3. Competency - It feels great to see a problem and know how to fix it... and if you can't, it's also great to know you have people and tools around you to help you build up the competencies to eventually be able to solve it. 

By focusing on the ABCs above and also being fair with the below, we hope we've got a formulae to build a happy, long-lasting team. 

## Mastery & Titles

We want our team to grow with us both in our reach but in your skills and understandings. Therefore, we outline clearly what we expect at each level for each team and offer support in helping you set goals to achieve this. We recognise that moving up generally means you become better and more efficient at what you do but it also involves challenging you more so we gradually add in more complexity and ask you to tackle more challenging problems â€“ it keeps it interesting and helps us achieve our never ending mission of solving problems others would rather not. 

Within each role, we have outlined five levels which all boil down to:

* Junior 
* Mid-weight
* Senior
* Team Lead
* Head/director

While it's important we help each person grow, we recognise that everyone learns at a different rate and also has different ambitions. Therefore, while each level will give an indication of how long we would expect you'd need to work commercially in that level, it's for reference sake. We know some people who started as a junior and moved up to senior in two years. For others, that may take more like 3-4 years... Also, some may want to take on more responsibility and manage a team while others would prefer to do their own thing. The beauty of our system is that this is all baked into our appraisal programme so we'll have regular conversations about how you're feeling, what skills or understandings you're trying to develop and generally where you ambitions lie so we can offer the support we can to help you achieve that.

* [Levels for Developers](/docs/{{version}}/levels-for-developers)
* [Levels for Designers](/docs/{{version}}/levels-for-designers)
* [Levels for Project Managers](/docs/{{version}}/levels-for-project-managers)

## Appraisal

To support your growth, we have an extensive route-based appraisal programme that you read more about [here](/docs/{{version}}/appraisal-programme). 

## Goal Setting

Our appraisal programme is based on setting SMART goals, thinking about actions, implementing and reflecting. You'll be provided tools to help with this and it's important that you revisit your goals at least once a month, at the start of a project and end of a project so you're able to make progress. 

These goals may connect to your ambitions to move up levels but it may also represent other things you're interested in. 

For example, Poppy, one of our project managers, once took a coding course. Not that it would necessarily directly help her move up a level but she thought it would be interesting and allow her to unlock conversations she could then have with the development team. 

## Pay & Promotions

We pay based on levels which primarily relate to your ability to work autonomously with key skills and understandings in an efficient and effective manner. 

Each level is broken down into pay bands. When you first start, we'll determine your level and payband within it by reviewing your self-assessment, test, experience, interview and references. We'll offer what we think is fair while trying to meet your needs. 

Pay is always tricky and while we do our best to be transparent, we also recognise that we are never going to be the Amazon of the world in what we can offer. That being said, while we know pay is an important factor in job satisfaction, we also think there are other really important keys to happiness that we cover including offering clear opportunities for professional growth, a team who works well, a stimulating environment of problem-solving and finally by taking on clients that are diverse and always present something new and fun to keep us all engaged. 

## Performance Feedback

We are always providing feedback - don't always expect us to schedule a formal "review" because you can expect to be talking about your code/designs/projects and getting feedback regularly. After all, regular feedback is a lot more important than waiting to get it officially once or twice a year. That being said, team leads will catch up you roughly monthly to discuss how your goals are progressing.  

## 1:1s

While you can expect to have quite regular 1:1 with your team lead, you'll chat with Nathan or Poppy at least once annually where we'll generally talk about:
- your daily work schedule and load
- your overall happiness
- your relationships with your team, team lead, and company
- your thoughts about professional growth and anything else we can do to help

Keep in mind, it's just as much a time for Nathan or Poppy to ask questions and feedback but we also equally want to hear about what we can do improve, too.
