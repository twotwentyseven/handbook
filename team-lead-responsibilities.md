# Team Lead Responsibilities

Each of our team leads are responsible for the well-being, professional growth and overall portfolio of projects of those who are in their team. Therefore, it’s important that you’re in regular communication, taking care of your team. Consider the following guide: 

## Daily Expectations

* See how your team members are feeling
* Offer support in any questions they may have
* Check on the status of their current project and act as an early warning detector if there are any challenges brewing (share this with the PM on the project - if you notice repeated issue, get Nathan involved earlier than later)

## Weekly: At the Beginning

* Check-in with the project team for what’s up that week
* Using this information to help you plan your week and what to cover in your daily check-ins

## Weekly: By the end 

* Briefly discuss how the week went with each team member using it as an opportunity to connect their work with their goals/plan (from the appraisal programme)
* Post any celebrations in the Slack channel compliments/thanks-yous
* Communicate updates on team and members to Nathan

## Monthly

* If you’re on a development team, code review a major piece of each team member’s work, with clear documentation in TW. 
* Keep the team fresh by leading/facilitating a workshop teaching your team a new skill/understanding.
* Meet with each team member to reflect on their appraisal criteria and/or their professional growth plan.


*A note about our team leads*. We encourage team leads to be "moonlight managers". To us that means they focus mostly on the work, and communication, and they allow the individuals on their teams to self-direct.

At the same time, we ask our team leads to take on a lot of responsibility for their teams! We very much appreciate that that may result in team leads doing some emotional labour. That sort of work is usually invisible and hard to quantify in the way product work is, and that’s okay! It’s part of a team lead's tough job, and we see that.

Team leads who feel that their energy for their own work is _consistently_ suffering as a result of people management means something isn't working or that you're not getting enough time for a project. You should raise this with Nathan so we can work on a solution.
