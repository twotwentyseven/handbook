# How We Work

## Projects

We're a creative digital agency that works with brands to get them online for the world. This means most everything we do is in the form of a project which may include starting from creating branding through designing a site to building it, launching it and getting into the wonderful world of email communication through CRM programmes. 

We outline everything we expect in a project life cycle in our [project playbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1szIUeI1UnClNAlaPNYG1Tc_0pREFpkLY2HDiIpv_Psc/edit?usp=sharing). You don't need to memorise this but it's important you at least understand how we work in any phase that your invlved in. You may also want to take a sneak peak at the phase before and after to get a taste of what's happened before the project has come to you. 

Projects have these generaly lifecyles:
1. Planning/scoping, discovery and digital strategy: This is when we try to understand the client's needs, what they like look and feel wise, what sorts of customer journeys we need to consider and the principles by which we will approach designing the full site. If a brand needs branding, we'll insert a phase for that just after this. 
2. Design: We'll first work on wireframes and a couple look and feel options for the site. We then jump into designing the full site. 
3. Design feedback: We seprate our feedback into it's own phase to give it dedicated time. We used to have it all in a single design phase but we felt this sometimes meant design never ended. This gives feedback a finite window and helps us keep the projects moving. The client gets a couple rounds to feedback before we get final approval. We try to communicate this means not much can change once we are in build but there's a feedback round after the build as we recognise that sometimes what was planned flat in Sketch doesn't always translate perfectly when it's dynamic so tweaks later on are inevitably needed. 
4. Build: Developers then take those approved design and build it out on Shopify or Laravel/Nova. Our developers test as they build and then conduct a full round of functional testing before a client ever sees a site. The goal is zero client reported bugs!
5. Build feedback: Clients get the site and give us a consolidated round of feedback. We recognise that we'll do most feedback now but always understand there will be a few tweaks after this. 
6. Launch: We always operate in launch windows to make sure we don't get stressed and can take care of any final last little tweaks. But then it's ready to showcase our work and the brand to the world. 


## Communication

We use Slack and Teamflow for all internal communication. We have made a concsicious choice not to have clients on Slack. Therefore, all client comms happen in a weekly status we keep during projects or email. The only reason we use email internally is to request holiday, confirm pay rises, position changes or other stuff we need a formal written record for. 

A few questions to consider so we have effective communication:

1. How is what I'm about to communicate best communicated?

- If it's a quick question that doesn't need an immediate answer, go for Slack. Slack is asychronous meaning someone will reply when they can.
- If it needs a discussion or is urgent, chat in person or call with one of our many tools.
- If there's a chance what you're saying is controversial or could be misinterpreted, chat in person or call with one of our many tools.

2. When should I communicate this?

- Am I unable to make any progress? If so, then get someone involved and tell them it's a priority. Determine how by using the questions before. 
- Are you in the heat of the moment? Maybe it's best to let it cool down a bit before you approach someone. 
- Is it low priority? If so, maybe put it in a list and get a few other things ready to ask about and then send it one go. 

3. Who do I need to communicate with?

- Are they available? We encourage team members to put in a headphone emoji on their status if they need some time to focus. Respect this and only break it if it's an absolute show stopper. 
- Could I check with anyone else? Sometimes we get an idea of who we need and don't consider if someone else could also help. Think whether anyone else could. 


## Consider Time

Not everything needs to be addressed immediately. Slack sometimes can make it feel like that. 

If you don't need an answer right away, maybe set a Slackbot reminder so you remember to ask someone. Or, maybe batch up your requests and ask someone if you can get their ear for 10 minutes just after their lunch. 

Mostly, it's important to remember that it takes about 10-15 minutes for someone to start to focus on something and when they're distracted it can take them that same amount of time to get back into the zone. 

We're certainly not saying avoid ever talking with anyone... we're just saying be concious of other's time and they'll do the same for you. 


## You're Your Own Manager

twotwentyseven isn't structured in such a way that each team lead can be all over their team members. Project managers equally aren't going to be hovering over you to get something done. Also, we never want to be that way. We want to give you autonomy. 

We ticket up work, brief each on it and expect you to be able to do it. If you can't, say it or better yet, say you can't but that you'll check with someone to learn how. Just be honest about how long that might take to learn. 

Are you running longer or finishing earlier on a task than expected? Don't just sit there, tell the project manager. We usually can get more time on things but we can only get more time if we know we need more time. If you've finished early, that's amazing so we can test it and get it to client ahead of schedule. Either way, take the reins and proactively communicate how you're doing so we're all aligned. 

## Balanced

We work a 40 hour week (we're currently experimenting with a 35 hours). That's it. Make sure you try to leave on time and disconnect so you can enjoy your time away from work. Because while we hope you love what you do, we also recognise that you can love other things, too... like a family, a pet, a plant, or a book. 

If you ever find you're consistently needing to in extra time to finish your work, raise that with your team lead and a project manager so we can make sure we figure out what's not quite going right so we can work on fixing it.
