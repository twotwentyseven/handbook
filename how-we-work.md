# How We Work

## Projects

We're a creative digital agency that works with brands to get them online for the world. This means most everything we do is in the form of a project which may include starting from creating branding through designing a site to building it, launching it and getting into the wonderful world of email communication through CRM programmes. 

We outline everything we expect in a project life cycle in our [project playbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1szIUeI1UnClNAlaPNYG1Tc_0pREFpkLY2HDiIpv_Psc/edit?usp=sharing). You don't need to memorise this but it's important you at least understand how we work in any phase that your invlved in. You may also want to take a sneak peak at the phase before and after to get a taste of what's happened before the project has come to you. 

Projects have these generaly lifecyles:
1. Planning/scoping, discovery and digital strategy: This is when we try to understand the client's needs, what they like look and feel wise, what sorts of customer journeys we need to consider and the principles by which we will approach designing the full site. If a brand needs branding, we'll insert a phase for that just after this. 
2. Design: We'll first work on wireframes and a couple look and feel options for the site. We then jump into designing the full site. 
3. Design feedback: We seprate our feedback into it's own phase to give it dedicated time. We used to have it all in a single design phase but we felt this sometimes meant design never ended. This gives feedback a finite window and helps us keep the projects moving. The client gets a couple rounds to feedback before we get final approval. We try to communicate this means not much can change once we are in build but there's a feedback round after the build as we recognise that sometimes what was planned flat in Sketch doesn't always translate perfectly when it's dynamic so tweaks later on are inevitably needed. 
4. Build: Developers then take those approved design and build it out on Shopify or Laravel/Nova. Our developers test as they build and then conduct a full round of functional testing before a client ever sees a site. The goal is zero client reported bugs!
5. Build feedback: Clients get the site and give us a consolidated round of feedback. We recognise that we'll do most feedback now but always understand there will be a few tweaks after this. 
6. Launch: We always operate in launch windows to make sure we don't get stressed and can take care of any final last little tweaks. But then it's ready to showcase our work and the brand to the world. 


## Communication

We use Slack and Teamflow for all internal communication. We have made a concsicious choise not to have clients on Slack. Therefore, all client comms happen in a weekly status we keep during projects or email. The only reason we use email internally is to request holiday, confirm pay rises, position changes or other stuff we need a formal written record for. 

A few questions to consider so we have effective communication:

1. How is what I'm about to communicate best communicated?

- If it's a quick question that doesn't need an immediate answer, go for Slack. Slack is asychronous meaning someone will reply when they can.
- If it needs a discussion or is urgent, chat in person or call with one of our many tools
- If there's a chance what you're saying is controversial or could be misinterpreted, chat in person or call with one of our many tools

## Pitches

Whether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.

Write-up your idea of a new feature, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considering as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.

There’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.

While a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next cycle, it’s more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. There are always more ideas than time, and we can only get a few things done each cycle. So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don’t be discouraged by this. We’ve had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening.

Jason, David, Ryan, and Jeff are the team evaluating pitches for inclusion in the next cycle. Before the start of every cycle, Jason’s kickoff will list all the pitches that have been selected to be worked on.

## Asynchronously

We have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at Basecamp. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that’s a feature not a bug. Most of the work you do at Basecamp shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.

It’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.

Don’t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that’s fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will).

All that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if it’s a one-day turn-around every time.

In certain departments, like Support and Ops, it’s even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there.


## In self-sufficient, independent teams

Organizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible.

Thus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.

For example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn’t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation.

Similarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly.

When we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don’t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.

None of this means we can’t talk together or ask experts with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn’t be a required, necessary step to make Basecamp better.

As soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for “the mobile integration”, we’re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. That’s a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.

## With managers of one

Managing at Basecamp is [part-time occupation](https://m.signalvnoise.com/moonlighting-managers-aint-got-no-time-for-bullshit/), next to being involved with doing the work itself. This means we rely on everyone at Basecamp to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as [managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully.

That means setting your own direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.

## Balanced

We limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.

There are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.
