# Getting Started

## Our Onboarding Process

twotwentyseven has grown a lot over the past couple of years which has meant welcoming many new team members. Our processes have grown and changed as a result and we hope you find your onboarding both welcoming and supportive. If you ever have any feedback, don't hold on it! Get in touch with your team lead, Nathan or Eric at any point if there's ever anything we can be doing better. 

## Before You Arrive

Before you start, you should expect to receive a couple of forms in addition to your contract (everything is sent and signed digitally). These forms contain some of the nitty gritty details to help us get you setup on payroll/pension but also include some lighter things like your spirit animal. 

You'll also get a company laptop and some equipment to help you get setup for hybrid working. 

If anything changes with your start date, please let your team lead know, and as always, reach out with questions at any point. 

We expect new people to show up in the office a bit more frequently than everyone else. This is to ensure you have time to meet everyone, integrate and properly learn from others. We'll share this schedule with you in advance, though. 

## Your First Day

We'll get you setup on all our systems. This is a bit of a bear but by the time you're done you'll have accounts on everything including:
- Shopify
- Gmail/Google Suite
- Teamwork
- Resource Guru
- Sketch
- 1Password
- Slack
- Teamflow
- Github (if needed)

You'll usually arrive around 10-11AM but then all following days we ask you work roughly the same hours as your team lead. 

## Your First Month

As a new member of our team, we’ll make sure you have time to get to know everyone, learn our processes and generally get to know the company’s approach. You’ll follow an on-boarding programme, some of which involves autonomous tasks and others you’ll work through collaboratively.  


By the end of the first month, you can expect:

- Learn how to navigate our various systems including Teamwork, Resource Guru, Google Apps, Slack, Shopify, Github and our servers (where applicable)
- Take part in regular conversations/check-ins with your team lead
- Developers will undertake smaller maintenance tasks and/or start on smaller project (depending on the studio schedule)
- Designers will create sections or make other minor updates to existing sites
- Project managers will be introduced to clients and mostly observe project briefings and subsequent planning
- To know more about [our appraisal programme](https://github.com/twotwentyseven/handbook/blob/master/appraisal-programme.md) and start to set goals for professional growth. 


## Your Second Month

With a good understanding of our systems and processes, you’ll start to take on more work while also working on developing relationships with your teammates. 

By the end of the second month, you can expect:

- Regular, daily use of our systems. You should start to feel comfortable using Teamwork and look to Resource Guru as your guide for what’s next.
- Daily check-ins with your team lead.
- Weekly reflection, with your team lead, using our appraisal criteria to start to identify areas you’re excelling and opportunities for growth.
- Developers and designers may start to take on full projects working closely with their team lead and Eric/Nathan for regular feedback.
- Project managers should start to expect to manage existing client relationships.


## Your Third Month

Depending on the studio schedule, we hope you have the chance to pick-up your first project that you are a part of from the beginning (i.e. a new client and a new site). You’ll be involved in the design and build process, working collaboratively with the project’s team. 

By the end of the third month, you can expect:

- Regular, daily use of our systems. You should feel at ease with all of our process-drive platforms (i.e. Teamwork, Slack Github). You still may be learning about the capabilities of Shopify/CodexFit/Laravel. 
- Weekly check-ins with your team lead. 
- Weekly reflection with your team lead, using our appraisal criteria clearly identifying and documenting where you excel and areas to grow. - You’ll make a plan including what resources you may need to learn. 
- Developers and designers are involved with a project from the outset. 
- Project managers will take ownership of their first full project. 

## Your Fourth Month, Onward

With a keen understanding of how we work, now in context of a real project, and with great relationships with the team, you’ll pass probation and officially be with us (hopefully) long-term. You’ll be on full projects while also supporting the company in maintaining existing sites. 

- Regular, daily use of our systems. You’re getting more and more comfortable with Shopify/CodexFit/Laravel. 
- Weekly check-ins with your team lead. 
- Monthly reflection with your team lead, using our appraisal criteria to celebrate what you’re doing well and following through on your plans to grow. 
- Developers and designers will have wrapped up at least one project they were involved with from the start. 
- Project managers will handover their first site and continue to build the client relationship.
