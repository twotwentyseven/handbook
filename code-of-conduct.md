# twotwentyseven's Code of Conduct

We want to build an inclusive team that is bound by their love of the web and tech who are passionate about launching awesome sites â€“ remember that from our founding, we've believed in the fundamental practice of building strong relationships with each other and those we work with. Considering this, it's important we recognise that to build this sort of team, we are free from discrimination of any kind. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to building strong relationships grounded in respect:

- Welcome others: Get to know each other and ask each other questions that aren't just about the task
- Seek understanding: You may disagree but don't rush to judgement and instead understand why someone did that or thinks something would work best
- Feedback for you and others: If you give feedback, frame it in a helpful way and if you're getting feedback, listen and consider it carefully

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by employees include:

- The use of any sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Insulting or derogatory comments
- Discriminating on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, nationality, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background, race, religion, or sexual identity or orientation.
- Public or private harassment
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

We're all responsible for upholding our code of conduct. 

## Scope

Our code of conduct applies while doing twotwentyseven work or representing us at any point outside of regular hours. 

## Enforcement

If you think something's gone wrong, try to address it with the person first but it's always okay to talk with your team lead if you're unsure about how to proceed. We certainly hope we hire people who wouldn't intentionally try to cause harm and with the increasing shift to digital comms, we can sometimes misinterpret messages so let's all make sure we give each other a chance and seek understanding. If there's still definitely something wrong, then again, seek out support from your team lead. 

If the issue is potentially more serious, we will follow the procedures as outlined in the [disciplinary procedures](https://github.com/twotwentyseven/handbook/blob/master/disciplinary-procedure.md)
