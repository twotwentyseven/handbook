# What We Stand For

We tell clients that we are proud to design, build and launch website that give them a competitive edge. 

The word choice of that simple statement is essential and much has to do with pride – we will do everything we can to produce work which we are happy to put our name on. So it really is about that feeling you get when you step back and say, "Wow, we created that..." feels great, right?

## Founding Principles

When we introduced twotwentyseven, we say it was founded based on two principles: we're problem solvers and we build long-lasting relationships. We hope and expect every team member to carry the torch on these whether that's in a client call, a project meeting, or selling us in a pitch. If we ever falter, raise your hand and call us on it – it's all of our responsibility to keep these in our DNA. 

## Our Values

We could probably come up with a list of a dozen values but ultimately we've settled on these core six that we try to focus on daily:

- Work-life balance: Get home on time and enjoy (at least) 31 holidays a year
- Autonomy: Freedom & trust to do your job
- Do it right & do it well: We do right for our clients and team the first time
- Fairness: Treating our team and clients with respect
- Time to play: You get time to try and learn new things
- Feedback to grow: Getting regular feedback to grow professionally

## Our Clients

We work with big companies and small. We work with start-ups and ones that have been going for many years. 

Each of these companies come to us because we sell ourselves as a team who cares and wants to help them evolve. 

It's fundamentally important we remember this and consider that everything any of us does or says doesn't just represent you but it represents everyone at twotwentyseven. So remember our values in any conversation you have and do us proud in any client conversation you have. 

## Our Team

We work hard to recruit the nicest, smartest, humble people we can find. We love everyone in our team and hope you do, too! 

We try to make sure everyone can play a part in the recruitment process and usually will invite candidates to meet the team on their final interview if we feel they have a chance to get offered the position. At that time, be honest about your experience and help us find the right people for the team. 

If you ever feel we can do something to improve the team's happiness, don't hesitate to talk with a team lead, Eric or Nathan.
