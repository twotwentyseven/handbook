# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I request holiday?

Send an email at least two weeks before you want holiday to holidays@twotwentyseven.com. If you're intending to take off quite a bit of time (i.e. 1-2 weeks) then please try to be sensible and request this at least a month in advance as it helps us get more time on a project so we don't need to rush it.


## How much can I flex my hours?

We ask everyone work a majority of their hours when most everyone else is online. Our office hours when clients can expect to get a hold of us are from 9AM to 6PM so try to get it around this. Something like 8-5 would be okay but probably not something like 12-10PM. Generally, try to start within an hour of 9AM and end within an hour of 6PM. 


## What do I do if I'm sick?

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if you're not well enough to work. We encourage our team to get rest and recover properly. So if you've decided it's best you take it easy, message your team lead and Eric that you need time away (Whatsapp is probably best for this, especially early in the morning or when we're not on Slack). If you're scheduled to work in the office and aren't well, then definitely don't come in then decide whether you can work while at home or if it's better to get rest. 

## What should I do if I have a doctor's appointment?

Try your best to schedule these in a way to limit the impact on work. Where you can't, though, we trust our team to make up the hours in a way that works with their schedule â€“ it's important to communicate that plan with your manager. Please let your manager know in advance of the time away either via Slack or a direct email. Then, when you're actually off on the day, use a Slack status to let others know you'll be away from your desk for a bit.
