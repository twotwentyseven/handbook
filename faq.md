# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I request holiday?

Send an email at least two weeks before you want holiday to holidays@twotwentyseven.com. If you're intending to take off quite a bit of time (i.e. 1-2 weeks) then please try to be sensible and request this at least a month in advance as it helps us get more time on a project so we don't need to rush it. 

## How much can I flex my hours?

We ask everyone work a majority of their hours when most everyone else is online. Our office hours when clients can expect to get a hold of us are from 9AM to 6PM so try to get it around this. Something like 8-5 would be okay but probably not something like 12-10PM.
