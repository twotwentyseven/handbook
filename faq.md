# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I request holiday?

Send an email at least two weeks before you want holiday to holidays@twotwentyseven.com. If you're intending to take off quite a bit of time (i.e. 1-2 weeks) then please try to be sensible and request this at least a month in advance as it helps us get more time on a project so we don't need to rush it.


## How much can I flex my hours?

We ask everyone work a majority of their hours when most everyone else is online. Our office hours when clients can expect to get a hold of us are from 9AM to 6PM so try to get it around this. Something like 8-5 would be okay but probably not something like 12-10PM. 


## What do I do if I'm sick?

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if you're not well enough to work. We encourage our team to get rest and recover properly. So if you've decided it's best you take it easy, message your team lead and Eric that you need time away. If you're scheduled to work in the office and aren't well, then definitely don't come in then decide whether you can work while at home or if it's better to get rest.
