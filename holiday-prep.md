# Anything I should be doing before/after I go on holiday?

If you're going on holidays, make sure you email holidays@twotwentyseven.com at least two weeks in advance for a shorter holiday and as far in advance for a longer one. This helps us plan our resource schedule and make sure we don't get into a pickle with how we schedule projects (i.e. promise something that then can't be done). 

If it's a short holiday (1-2 days) then you probably will need to do very little to prepare. If it's longer then follow the below procedure. 

Everyone should prepare for going on holiday by creating a handover plan. Some may find this is shorter than others, eg you're a developer and nothing has been purposefully scheduled during your holiday vs a project manager which will need to provide more extensive notes.

On the rare occassion, it may also include making sure your team lead has your phone number just in case there's anything urgent we cant figure out – we'll do our best to make sure you're not contacted, though. 

## Developers/Designers

Developers and designers should talk with their team lead about a week before their leave to discuss what might be needed. More than anything, it's an opportunity to talk about things that may come up over the week. For example, if you just launched a website it may be worth flagging that we're still on the lookout for client requests so we may need to jump on those quicker. Or maybe we've handed over designs for review and it's making sure all the fonts/files etc are easily accessible by the team in case any minor things are needed while you're away. 

When you're back, check in again with your team lead – preferably before you even try to check emails or Slack. 

## Project Managers

Project managers need to prepare a plan including:
- Client name
- Main contact name
- Email address and phone number
- Current status of the project
- Anything that needs to be done while you're away, who is responsible, and when it should be done

Project managers should ensure their clients know at least 1-2 weeks in advance of an extended holiday and should be introduced to whomever is going to take responsibility for the project while you're away. Please ask the client to understand requests may take longer to reply to and only urgent matters should be raised to this person. 

When you're back, check in again with your team lead – preferably before you even try to check emails or Slack. The person who was responsible for your projects will have added a new column to the spreadsheet to cover what happened on each of your projects while you were away.
