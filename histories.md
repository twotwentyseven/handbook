# A Few Histories

## CodexFit

CodexFit began as an idea in 2018 and officially went live in 2019. Up until 2018, twotwentyseven got a bit of a name for buliding bespoke booking platforms – we built a dozen or so. These were fun and all but a beast to maintain and many of them shared a lot of similarity. 

We therefore decided to build a white labelled booking platform. 

We built it to natively support subscriptions and credit based bookings and created in such a way that allowed an incredible level of flexibility that all of our clients say is unparalleled when compared with the competition. 

One thing that makes it so flexible are the frontend components which are based in Vue.js but which can be overridden to achieve almost any look and feel. That's a far cry from the iFrames that many of our competitors use. 

After about a year, we adjusted the frontend components and upgraded all of our sites to v2 which were more stable and more flexible. They also all now contained a base template so they could be more easily and quickly installed on a site therefore reducing our integration fees. 

When the pandemic started, we quickly pivoted and integrated an on demand and streaming component directly in the platform. It's what allowed Psycle to launch Psycle at Home to their existing 180,000 customers all without needing to make a single login and give them a chance to buy a plan on the credit card already on their account. 

The team behind CodexFit borrows a lot from twotwentyseven but is growing. We went from just one location on CodexFit to about 16 just 1.5 years after the platform launched. 

In the future, we want to make integrations ever faster so we can scale the platform more easily. Nonetheless, we have a measly 200 feature requests sitting in the pipeline so we're sure to be busy for quite a long time. 

## Shopify

This one isn't so much a product but something we think we've been on the cutting edge of for a while and continue to be as we push the limits of what you can without needing Shopify Plus. 

When Shopify was first introduced, it was a hard sell to clients. Most wanted Magento and Wordpress/WooCommerce which were more established. We slowly won client over and now every client coming to us found us because of our expertise in Shopify. 

Early on, we won some awards where Shopify recognised us as one of the pre-eminent partners. And again in 2020, we were invited, applied and accepted into Shopify's Strategtic Partnerships Programme which is reserved for the top 1% of Shopify Partners globally. It gives us special access to early features and support tools that allow us to grow our skills faster than others. 

The most important thing for us in Shopify is directly connected to our founding principles – we are always pushing it and looking for new tools to make our Shopify sites next level.
