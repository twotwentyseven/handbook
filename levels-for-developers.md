# Levels for Developers

We use the following as a guide to help us/you determine your level. It shouldn't be interpreted as a be all and end all list of what we expect but it's a great start to help you understand what we reasonably think someone should be able to do at each level. Make sure to also take into account our appraisal criteria when self-assessing yourself, determining performance and setting goals. 

Keep in mind that you should be able to achieve these things well, repeatedly. That means achieving the levels on a single project is great but it should be replicable from project to project to really show you've established yourself in that particular level. Once you've done that, look at the next level and set out small but manageable steps to move towards it.
