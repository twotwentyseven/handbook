# Appraisal Programme


## Introduction

We value a highly-skilled team that feels they can work autonomously while also knowing they have support to improve. 

We don’t have any desire to micro-manage, allowing you to get on and enjoy the work without excessive admin while also ensuring we support each team member in identifying where they are excelling and where they can make some improvements. 

Our appraisal programme aims to accomplish this by outlining three routes a twotwentyseven team member may take. 


## Three Routes Overview


### Route 1: Observation 

The observation route includes more regular code reviews and meetings with your team lead and occasionally with Eric and Nathan. 

Any new team member will automatically go on the observation route for the first six months. This includes the first three months of probation (probation periods may be set for a longer duration depending on the position but this will be made clear during the hiring process). 

For everyone else, following six months to one-year of observation, a team member can opt to move to route 2 or stay on route 1 - this will be a conversation between the team member and team lead to decide what would be most advantageous. 

All team members will be on route 1 at least once every two years. 


### Route 2: Personal Growth Plan

After moving through route 1, a team member in collaboration with their team lead, may opt to go into a personal growth plan. 

The goal of route 2 is to allow a team member to explore something they are passionate about or have always wanted to improve upon but may have not had time to do this. Whatever the team member chooses would need to demonstrably be useful to both the team member, team and greater business. 

For example, a project manager may want to spend time looking at codeless automation tools or a designer may want to take a course on a particular area of UX. A backend developer may want to explore a new CMS or a frontend developer may want to take a course in Vue. 

During route 2, a team member will be provided dedicated time each week to develop this new understanding/skill. twotwentyseven will also support the team member if there was any additional cost for this training. 

In an ideal world, this new learning would also be shared with the rest of the team in a workshop or team demo. 


### Route 3: Formal review

In a circumstance where a team member has gone through either route and has demonstrated problems which are repeatedly continuing despite advice/warnings, they may find themselves on route 3. Examples which may lead a team member to being placed on route 3, include but not limited to:



*   A failure to make sufficient progress on areas of improvement noted in either route - especially if the area of improvement has come up repeatedly over the course of review meetings with your team lead
*   Bugs repeatedly being introduced on sites - especially bugs of similar nature and of higher priority
*   Client complaints which lead to them potentially ceasing business with the company
*   Issues with time on task or efficiency where you are not meeting expectations with project delivery timelines

Route 3 is intended to help team members improve while also providing clear and specific objectives which must be met in order to continue working at the company. A failure to meet objectives would result in written notice/dismissal. 


## Route Specifics


### Route 1: Observation

The goal of this route is to facilitate learning through regular code/design reviews and catch-ups to both identify areas where you are excelling and note where to improve. In collaboration with your team lead and/or training opportunities, you should expect to make consistent improvement in the areas identified. 

There are [criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eEBAq0MaesasLfxVIfSSLElQoSwTPE6wYmUii471X-E/edit?usp=sharing) which will be used to help guide you during this route. For example, you may realise that you sometimes fall short of fully implementing coding standards, so you may decide to really focus on this as an area to improve. Or, you may decide that time keeping isn’t really your cup of tea and set an explicit goal to log time more like Paul. Or maybe you have a bad case of the cold and there are a couple bugs which keep evading you - it’s time to figure out why and make a plan to avoid it in the future. 

A team member can be on observation for six months and up to a year. After this, you may move onto personal growth or may be moved to route 3. All new team members start on observation and continue after successfully passing probation, albeit with slightly less frequent reviews/catch-ups.

### Route 2: Personal Growth Plan

We value taking initiative and solving problems! This route is meant to provide you a means to put this value into action. While on this route, you will be provided half a day per week to grow. Ideally, a personal growth plan lasts between 2-6 months. You could finish one plan and start another, too. 

**Steps for Personal Growth Plan**

**1. Brainstorm _(1-2 weeks)_**

In the beginning of this route, you should take time to consider passions or skills you’ve always wanted to develop but have not yet had time to give it a try. Make a list, brainstorming the different possibilities. While you brainstorm, consider how this may be both beneficial to yourself, the team and the greater business. 

**2. Meet with your team lead** _(1 week)_

In collaboration with your team lead, meet to discuss these ideas. During this discussion, if you already have an idea of one specific idea you want to pursue, make that clear. If, however, you are between a handful of different ideas, discuss:

*   Pros
*   Cons
*   Time needed
*   Resources needed (training, etc)

**3. Write a proposal _(1 week)_**

After leaving this discussion, research the top topics/ideas and write a proposal. The proposal can take the format you most feel comfortable with but should broadly include:

1. Name of your plan
2. Why you’re passionate/interested in the topic
3. Skills you aim to develop
4. Benefits to you - if possible, reference previous projects where this may have been useful
5. Benefits to your team/business
6. Amount of time needed
7. Timeline of plan - map out what you’ll likely be doing each week for the duration of the plan. Your team lead will use this to check-in with you
8. Resources you’ll need - note cost of any materials/training you may need

**4. Catch-up with your team lead _(1 week)_**

During the catch-up, share your proposal with your team lead. It’s an opportunity to get feedback and discuss what you’ll be up to for the next few months. Following this catch-up, update the proposal and send it to your team lead for final go ahead. 

**Following proposal approval _(2-4 months)_**

It’s now time to get to work. Make sure you have time resourced each week to work on your personal growth plan (check with Eric/Poppy). And check-in with your team lead about twice a month, preferably at the end of the half-day you have resourced. 

You should keep a journal of your learning - this can be short but include a bullet point listed as you learn and/or notes from your catch-ups with your team lead. 

**Workshop/demo**

As a celebration of your learning, we’ll set time aside in the schedule with anyone in the company who may benefit. 

When you feel you are getting close to the end of the project, it’s time to consider how you may share this information with the team. In collaboration with your team lead, discuss the best format for this which may include a workshop to share your new learning or maybe a demo of something you’ve designed/built. 

**After workshop/demo**

You may opt to go into a new personal growth plan, continue to develop the original plan or move onto route 1. Discuss with your team lead what’s best for you.

### Route 3: Formal Review

Formal review is reserved for cases in which a team member has had repeated issues and is given a specific time window in which to improve or potentially be dismissed from the company. Our first priority in formal review is to help you understand what our overarching concerns are and to support you in making improvements. 

If you are being placed on route 3, a meeting will be scheduled to share this with you along with:



*   Major concerns
*   Specific evidence to demonstrate those concerns
*   Next steps
*   Objectives you need to meet
*   Formal notification that you have a specific time window to improve

Notes of this meeting will be taken and a copy provided to the team member as well as a copy stored with the company. 

It is important that this is taken seriously. 

Following the initial meeting, you should expect that your team lead checks in with you weekly regarding progress on the objectives. Both yourself and team lead will document your progress as outlined in the objectives. 

You will be provided with training materials to support your improvement and guidance from your team lead. We expect team members to work as autonomously as possible during this process - we want you to own your improvement and show you’re taking the initiative. 

As a general rule, team members are given four weeks to show improvement. At the end of the four weeks, another meeting will be scheduled to discuss the results. 

Notes of this final meeting will be taken and a copy provided to the team member as well as a copy stored with the company.  

If, at the end of the time window, objectives **have been met** you will enter into an extended review period of three months where objectives must be maintained. If those objectives are not, this results in being served with a written notice/dismissal. 

If, at the end of the time window, objectives **have not been met**, you will be served with a written notice/dismissal.
