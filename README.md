# twotwentyseven Team Handbook

We existed for over 10 years without a handbook. But, as we grow we realised that we had files all over the place and it was creating for an inconsistent onboarding experience. That sort of meant if you were a chatty Kathy that you'd probably know more compared to a silent Sean. 

Therefore, we've centralised all of our stuff into one nifty place. 

This handbook represents an attempt at helping you learn more about twotwentseven but certainly still isn't as exhaustive as it could be. Within it you're learn about our history, what excites us, some rituals we need you to learn, how you can grow, who does what, and more about our processes. 

If you ever have any feedback, get in touch with Eric and we'll do our best to get this updated. It's a work in progress, after all.
