# Benefits & Perks

While benefits and perks are nice, we first and foremost try to ensure we are fair and transparent with pay (we don't think there's a point in giving you a free lunch if you aren't making enough to have dinner later!). 

That being said, a perk is definitely nice here and there. Annually we evaluate what we offer, comparing ourselves to others and considering what members of our team value. 

## Pension Contributions

All team members are automatically enrolled in a workplace pension (unless you opt-out in your onboarding form). We will contribute 3% and you 5%. The short story is that it's like getting a 3% top-up. You can increase your contributions at any time but this must be done before the 10th of the month to take effect for the end of month pay period. 

## Holidays

We have 28 days holiday (inclusive of bank holidays in the UK) per year (starting in January through December) plus we also shut the office down during Christmas and don't count these days against your allocation. You'll accumulate holidays at the rate specified in your contract so if you join mid-way through the year, keep that in mind. 

You need to request time off at least two weeks in advance by sending an email to holidays@twotwentyseven.com. You shouldn't book any holidays until you have approval. We rarely, if ever, turn away holiday requests but please be sensible and look ahead as we need to ensure we don't have an entire team gone. Also, because we work on project schedules, it's really helpful if we can get some idea of your longer holidays so we can make sure plan around this and extend project timelines so we don't need to rush through work. End of the day, we want you to take time off so help us, help you by letting us know when you need some R&R. 

## Reduced Hours

Starting in January 2021, we began a trial to reduce our working day from 8 hours plus 1 hour lunch to 7 hours plus hour lunch. This was initially introduced to help people disconnect and better balance their work and personal life in the midst of a pandemic and lockdown. We're still running this trial and are curious how it works in a hybrid model. We may change back or alter this depending on feedback and company performance. 

## Free Lunches

When we're in the office, we provide a free lunch three days a week. During the pandemic, we offered everyone a weekly Deliveroo of their choice. 

## Team Outings

We like to celebrate the incredible work of the team and generally do this once a month by going out to enjoy a beverage at a local pub. 

## Twice Annual Parties

We appreciate the hard-work our team puts in and while we endeavour to say thanks and show this appreciation throughout the year, we take it up a level once sometime in the summer and another time around Christmas. We try to do something creative each time to gel as a team and have some fun together. 

## Gym Contributions

We like to stay healthy and encourage our team to get fit. Outside of free credits we get from all the gyms we work with, we also contribute to gym memberships. If you would like to avail this, please send an email to Eric and Nathan and we'll look at the options. Generally, we contribute up to Â£20/month which you'd take as a taxable benefit or we also have a gym nearby the office that we can enrol you directly. 

## Home Office Setup

We get all of our team members a laptop they can bring home. We also offer team members a sweet screen, dongle, and some stationary to help you settle in at home and be your most productive self. 

## Bereavement Leave

A particularly challenging one to talk about but nonetheless worth discussing. If you lose someone in your family whom you are close to, please communicate this at the earliest to your team lead and we'll talk about what we can do. Sometimes people need a little time off and others prefer a distraction. Either way, we're here to talk and discuss options. 

## Maternity/Paternity Leave (reconsider name)

Having a baby is, apparently, an amazing thing - but it's also a physically, mentally and emotionally demanding time, during which people often struggle to get the rest they need.  We offer the standard Statutory Maternity Leave and Statutory Paternity Leave, as well as additional perks such as adjusted working hours, options to switch to part-time employment, a new baby package to welcome your little one into the world, and are flexible when it comes to how you wish to return to work.  Please speak to a senior manager, Eric or Nathan for more information.
