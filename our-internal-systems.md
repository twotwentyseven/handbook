# Our Internal Systems

## Teamwork

This is our project management tool (referred to as TW). We all use this daily and it's where a project and all of it's tasks live. Developers, designers and projects managers all keep time here. We also use it to bill clients. It's pretty important and something you'll learn right away. 

## Resource Guru

This is where we plan how we are using everyone's time, something we lovely call resource (we refer to this as RG). The project management team meets weekly to discuss how we're allocating time and will sometimes need to make adjustments throughout the week based on requests that come in. It's like a massive, complicated puzzle that we're always trying to get right... please be patient with us, we try our best... we're in high demand and thus the reason we're growing. 

Everyone gets a daily RG email saying what's on their schedule that day. It's top-line. We always try to link your daily list to a specific task or task list in teamwork. When in doubt, get in touch with a project manager who booked you and they'll help get you ready for the task. 

## Slack

An important tool for comms and get a hold of people. Remember, it's not necessarily meant to be instantaneous. Everyone starts they day by planning what they're going to do, any roadblocks they may hit and generally what they're trying to achieve. They then post a summary of this planning on Slack in announcements and get cracking. 

## TeamFlow

A new tool we're experimenting with, TeamFlow (referred to as TF) is like having a virtual map of our office that you can move around and talk with others. You're little avatar can approach others and they can start to hear you the closer you get to them. It's a great tool to get a few people together, share a screen and have a chat. What's nice is that others can get involved so if they see you talking about something, just like the real office, they can roll over and contribute. Or, if you're like Sam, just experience massive fomo and need to listen in. 

## Gmail/Google Suite

We use Gmail, Meet, Google Docs, Sheet and Slides. Email is a tool more use for clients but as covered in other parts of this handbook, we use it for formal things like holiday requests and pay rises. We use Meet for all virtual calls. We use docs to brainstorm, sheets to do a dreaded product upload or more fun cost calculation, and slides for when we're pitching or putting together workshops with clients. 

Keep your files in Google Drive. That's especially useful when we need to share things with team members and things don't get lost on a device. 

## Zendesk

This is our support tool for CodexFit. If you need to use it or support us in serving CodexFit customers, you'll get trained on it. Remember, whenever you use ZenDesk, you're representing twotwentyseven and CodexFit. Be a lovely human being. 

## 1Password

Security is important to us. Every password you use must be generated randomly in 1Password and stored there. The only password you need to memorise then is the password to get into 1Password. But we're serious, only use good passwords you generate in 1Password and whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication. 

## FreeAgent

This handles all of our invoices but it's also where you can see your payslips. You'll get access just before you get paid for the first time. 

## Github

We use this to store all of our repos. And this handbook!

## Sublime

The editor of choice on the team and the one you'll most likely to be able to get neat workarounds from others on the team is Sublime. 

## Sketch

Our design team use this to produce wireframes and desktop/mobile designs. Our developers use those Sketch files to build amazing sites.
