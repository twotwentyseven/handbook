# Vocabulary

Developers seem to have some funny terms. This list will probably grow as our team does and maybe we'll even pick up something bizarre from a designer or project manager. For now, anyone can submit updates to this to expand our little dictionary so when new team members join, they don't feel left in the dust. 

## Rubber Ducking

If a developer ever needs to talk through a problem, they'll ask someone or something to be their rubber duck. It basically means they need to talk out a problem in order to solve it. The person or thing they talk to may not even necessarily need to help but it's the pure act of verbalising something that can help resolve it.
