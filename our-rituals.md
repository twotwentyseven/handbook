# Our Rituals

## Announcements

Every morning on Slack, we ask each team member to post a brief summary of their plan for the day. But, and this is a big one, don't just roll out of the bed or get into the office, open up the laptop and type in the first few things that come to mind. Take 5 minutes to review what's on Resource Guru, what's up next in Teamwork, think about what you're about to build and what challenges you may encounter. Have you done that now? Great, now you can post. Make sure it answers these questions:

- What are you trying to achieve today?
- What challenges or roadblocks may you encounter?
- Who's help might you need and when?

## Beginning of the Week Kick-off

On the first working day of the week at 9:30AM, we'll get on a call and the project management team will briefly highlight the big things for each team member. We do this because we think it's important that everyone on the team have at least a little awareness of what their colleagues are up to. So please avoid the temptation to do your own as this is the time to appreciate the other things happening with the team. And who knows, maybe someone else is working on a project you originally were involved with and you can run over to them after to let them know you're there to help out if needed. 

## End of Week Wrap-ups

At the end of each week, we'll have a call or meet in person to celebrate the wins from the week. It's a time to recognise the good things and at least once a month, Poppy will update on the new business pipeline so everyone has some awareness of who we're talking with and what's on the horizon. 

## Compliments and Thank Yous

We've got a dedicated channel in Slack where you can compliment other members of the team or thank someone. It's a bit public but that's okay – we're trying to build a team that goes out of their way to recognise the good things that others are up to. So feel free to pop in a message and give someone a shout out. We hope that'll make their day and also spread some positivity. 

## Teamwork Updates

This is a bigger process one but we use TW for all tasks so whether you're doing a little maintenance thing or building a full site, we use TW. 

### In a Project

If you're in a project, we'll use boards. The project manager will put anything that needs to be done in an up next board. We've made this dead simple so if you're the designer or developer and you start working on something, move that task into the in progress board. Finished it? Then move it in your ready for my review. Have you done your own review? Great, then move it into ready for final review. It's really that simple. The boards will automatically notify the right people, change ownership, and dates. Done – all the communication that needs to happen is done by the robots. 

### Outside a Project

After a project finishes, we generally move out of boards. If that's the case and you finish a task, make sure you re-assign the task to the project manager so they can do their final testing. It's helpful to leave a comment letting them know about this and anything in particular that you'd like them to look for when they conduct their final test. 

## Process

We love process. It's what keeps us efficient and able to serve such big name brands. We've tried to distil our process into a project playbook covering every phase of a project [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mxsi8kfXtp6sJwZoFZxxGOx2mLu6GmprOO36Jleoa9Y/edit?usp=sharing).
